### Lab 3 
### (Un)Informed Search


  *  Which heuristics did you use for the A* algorithm?
  ```
abc
code
code 
code
```
  * Test your program with a couple of different problems. Increase the size of the problem to test the limits of your program. Make a table comparing how many nodes are searched to find the answer for each problem. For this table, you should compare a number of different problems (at least 3) to avoid a statistical bias. Which of the three algorithms (UCS, A with consistent and and A with an inconsistent heuristic) searches the least nodes and * which one take the most?
  * Why does this happen?
  * Which algorithms are optimal? Why?
  *  In your opinion, what are the benefits of simpler algorithms versus more complex ones?
